PageInitiliazer = initializes pages

BDD - benefit = main purpose BDD is it is process that creates collaboration between non technical and technical
members fo the team.
Benefit of Cucumber is = plain language, open source and free to use, it is compatible and can be integrated with
different programing languages and automation tools as well.

TestRunners
SmokeRunner = only smoke tests
RegressionRunner =
FailerRunner =

Runner class:
it help us execute our cucumber tests by using JUnit.
We use Cucumber  to run our test (JUnit as well)

when dryRun is TRUE and it will not execute because in login.feature we do not have unimplements methods.
dryRUN is TRUE = it will implement only unimplemented methods.
when dryRun is FALSE = it will not run

What is the point of multiple tag ??? = >

if to run with multiple tags:
tags = {"@smoke, "@whatever"}

with PLUGIN = we can generate reports, etc

PRETTY will print steps inside the console

dry run looks ahead  --finds unimplemented--->doesn’t run at all
srtict - runs-->finds unimplemented methods -->fails

"html:target/cucumber-default-reports"} )// it will generate html default page for us
html:   = report
target/cucumber-default-reports" where and the name of the report

json file is used to get report, but in general json is used for API testing. JSON file is data storage.
JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner.

HOOKS = benefit is when we start our scenario , but are the steps that we constinutely perform (like login and quite)
will give us opportunity to run our test without reusing our steps? // this is not clear, check google
it is executed based on annotations, it is annotation-based function from cucumber (from io.cucumber.java)

Hooks = execute at the beginning and quitting : launching, navigating and quitting

HOOKs are annotation baed library which give us an opportunity to start a test adn end the test

@After annotation will be executed no matter of the result of the test. @After will be executed anyway.

Screenshot = we should put ..

Cucumber itself doesn’t provide functionality for taking screenshots,
but it does make it possible to embed them in the report.

HW:
Come up with test scenarios which adds an employee
1. Without login details
2. with login details

we need to create new feature file
scenario
implement steps
and past them in new stepdefinition class
and implement actions

HW
Create 2 more runners
Smoke Test
Regression Test

the purpose of FAILER.Runner is collect failed cases = we should specify only failed scenarios,
we do not need to give whole path to features and run only failed tests.

JIRA:

work assignment
Tracking our progress of our project that we are working on. Trackign our work.

=============
of the topic
how to close/dismiss pop-up ads
if it inpectable, then we can click on it . we do not have to switch, it is just an element.
In this case , there should be a condition. and it is better to do it manually. In real life project
we will not see unexpected pop up.
